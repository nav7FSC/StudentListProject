# Student List Project

## Overview

The Student List Project is a simple Java application designed to manage and display a list of student names. The project consists of two main classes:

1. **Student**: Represents a student with a name.
2. **StudentLst**: Manages the list of students, collects input from the user, and displays the student names.

## Files

- `Student.java`: Contains the `Student` class with attributes and methods for managing student names.
- `StudentLst.java`: Contains the `StudentLst` class, which handles user input, creates `Student` objects, and displays the list of student names.

## Features

- **Student Class**:
    - Holds the student's name.
    - Provides a constructor to initialize the name.
    - Includes getter and setter methods for the name.

- **StudentLst Class**:
    - Prompts the user to enter names for a fixed number of students.
    - Creates `Student` objects based on user input.
    - Displays all student names in a formatted string.

## Example
